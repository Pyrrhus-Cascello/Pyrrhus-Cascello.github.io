<p>READY TOOOOOO GAAAAMMMBLE?!?!?!?!? Then play the SCOTTY SLAUGHT'S SLOTS slots (I don't even know what I was thinking for the name so don't ask). Before we started Mr.B-Rocky (not his real name but I bet he doesn't want his name on the internet) told a story about a regret he had when marking a students slot machine. He said that his code was beautiful and the slot machine had a ASCII hand that would pull down when you said go! But he docked him one mark for a very simple aaccidentally mistake. HE FORGOT TO FORMAT HIS PAGE! But the best part came when that student became a TEACHER at this very school! Mr.B-Rocky said that he wondered if he remembered him docking him a mark.</p>

<p> So being me I wanted to one up a teacher I finished what he asked for then I started to take it home. Taking it home allowed me have more time to work on it and trust me if you want something to be good you can't use the time the teacher gives you, you need to do it at home.In my case the programs he used was free to download on my computer if you can't you can try go in during lunch and code.</p>

<p> It was getting to the end of the project, I finished it couple days before but I started to think of what else I could add and started to work on a design to have a menu were you can choose what game you want to play and the other game was going be black jack. But I changed my mind since I didn't wanna be late and not to mention all of my friends was telling me to stop and go die because I made their code look bad.</p>

<p>But when I handed the slot machine in I made a terrible mistake I had spelling and grammer errors. However, that day history did not repeat its self and I got perfect on that project. But at the end of the year Mr.B-Rocky told me my mark would be in the 90s because my code was so great but it was held down because my english D: it was so sad to hear but atleast I had a reason why I had a lower mark and I prefer to hear that I suck instead of sugar coating it.

<p>I would put photos here but honestly I don't realy feel like this is really that Impressive so why did I even post this you may ask and my anwser is because it was one of my better programs in computer science.
