<p>It was kind funny/sad how I got put back into grade 11 computer science. Back in end of grade 11 I was selceting my courses I asked for grade 12 computer science but it turned out that grade 12 computers was also running over my grade 12 math so I couldn't take it. When school started It said I had a course called leadership and peer surport with Mr.B-Rocky. I was like cool I guess but when it came time to go to class the first thing he said was "Welcome too ICS3U" (computer science grade 11) I was so confused. Eventually I figured out that the guidance teacher putted me there like I will get a credit for leadership and peer surport but I will do ICS3U work. </p>

<p>So the big project we got was only a week in since everyone wanted out of small basic becasue they hated it so much. Since they didn't know much about small basic Mr.Berocky gave us a simple to code project but since I spent half of a sermester in it that task was way to easy for me. Since I knew how to use graphical Interfaces and amke things clickable I started to make a click based adventure game<p>

	<p>If you were wondering yes I did alot of the work at home. You can't make anything amazing just doing it school!</p>
<p>This may also the last school project post in a while since we are using visual basic and the files are to big for me to bother uploading them to the site. However, I think we are going to move from visual basic soon but depends on what we do in java.</p>

<p>Photos I will get around to it :3</p>
