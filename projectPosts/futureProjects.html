<hr>

<article>
<p>Hey I see you are Interseted in the furture projects of what I am going to do. In this section of the site I'll keep the projects
I would like to start sometime in the future.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Improve my site!</h2>

<p> I just feel like I can make this site even better then it is right now. for example I can organize my code better, Make it so when I post something or update a post it will be automatically moved to the top of that page it is. Fix the alignment of some of the items on website IDK if you notice but it REALLY bugs me. It's really noticeable on mobile

<h2> Building a pinball machine! </h2>

<p> Its kinda funny how I decide that I wanted to do this (not really ;3). So it started back in christmas 2015 and my dad got me an arduino uno and honestly I had no clue what I wanted to do with it so I really just putted away I had two ideas either make a rpg led stripe (I never really tried to figured out how to do it and now I don't have them up anymore since I re did my room) and my other idea was a ddr pad but that crashed when I figured out that I need a somthing more like an Arduino Leaonardo since I wanted to hook it up to my pc. </p>

<p> So you are probably wondering why I even told you that and it was just FILLER!! but yea I had an arduino that I wanted to use. I went to the halloween maker expo 2017 because I saw one of my favorite youtubers was going to be there (the hacks smith) but I also saw that a diy pinball people where going to be there so I checked them out even tho I didn't really learn anything from them It did expired me to build my own pinball machine. And yes I did saw James but I didn't talk to him :3 I didn't know what to say so I just looked at the gadgets in PERSON! and moved on (it wasn't even busy yet so I could of talked to him). </p>


<p>So yea I feel like it is about time for me to start talking about what I have for the Pinball machine and honestly not much. I'm
just doing research on it and I have a good idea what I gotta do for the flippers and the pop bumpers.I'm going to use 12v door actuator mainly it seems like it would good and also cheaper! </p>

<h2>Cosplaying the Fallout series.</h2>

<p>This is somthing I wanted to do for awhile. I either want to make the NCR vet. ranger from New Vegas or the t 45 power armour (atleast the helmets). Really the only thing that is stopping me is just spending the money to start making it. It was also because I wasn't sure where to get grey Eva foam however, A person at work who does cosplay pointed out that I am going to paint i anyways. So it doesn't matter what colour it is, I'm not sure why I thought that I need to use grey so all I need is the eva foam wich I am going to cheat and ask for it for christmas 2017 :3 </p>

<p>here are some pictures of the ranger and the power armour.If for some reason you don't play fallout</p>

<p>for the base for the ranger helment would be a fake Army M1 Helmet. It seems like it would be a good base I would also probably have a working light and fan for the helment.For the power armour helmet I'll probaly steal some ideas from Gustav Ljungdahl like using a bucket and a hard hat for the helmet. However, I do want to make the lights working too</p>

<h2>Crafting a lightsaber</h2>

<p>I love starwars it is one of my favorite universes. To be honest I haven't watched the original movie (AKA not the new ones made by Desiney) in a long time but I am looking into re watching them. However I do play a lot of the starwars games (like Battle front 2 [orginal], starwars knights academy, old republic 1/2 ).  </p>

<p> At the moment I am obsessee with a curved hilt lightsabers so thats probaly what I am going to make. I am also probably going to use a orange colour saber because I like orange and it is unquie (you don't really see that colour often)

<p>
Im not to sure about design but I think a leather warp handle would be nice. Based on my reasherch I realy need pvc pipes and other plumbing items to make the shell of the hilt and a see through tube for the saber part. Really the only expensive thing is just the sound board, the motion dection, and led. Hopefully I can get around to doing it soon!

<h2>The 3D Printer.</h2>

<p>Honestly this is rather straight forward I want a 3D printer pre built or DIY.</p>

<p>The 3D printer would allow me to expand on what kind of projects I can do like cosplay, Robotics, toys, and just simple prints to make things more efficient. Something I want to try is making a EDF powered rc car kinda like Ivan Miranda did. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Development to my game Idea.</h2>

<p> Not much to read for this its top secert right now since I don't want the idea  to be stolen because I bet someone else has thought of that idea too. So I won't talk about this in tell I start making it. I have this here just so you know that its somthing I want to do</p>

<h2>BOAT, BOAT BOAT, BUILDING!</h2>

<p>Something I wanted to do for a long time and something I probably won't do in a long time. It is kinda sad that I won't be able to do this but building boats are expensive. Oh and keep in mind I HAVE NO CLUE HOW TO SAIL! So yea not to much to say here just that I love wood working and that is somthing I want to do when I have the money. If you are wonder <a href="https://www.storerboatplans.com/design/goat-island-skiff-simple-sailing-boat-excellent-performance-lightweight/" title="goat island skiff" class="link" > This is the boat </a> I want to build </p>
