<p>Hey I see you are Interseted in the furture projects of what I am going to do. In this section of the site I'll keep the projects
I would like to start sometime in the future.In this moment of time I am not sure how I will do project updates It may be under things I've done or What I am up maybe I'll do it in form of tweets not to sure but This site is still under construction.I'm sure I'll figure somthing out</p>

<h2> Building a pinball machine! </h2>

<p> Its kinda funny how I decide that I wanted to do this (not really ;3). So it started back in christmas 2015 and my dad got me an arduino uno and honestly I had no clue what I wanted to do with it so I really just putted away I had two ideas either make a rpg led stripe (I never really tried to figured out how to do it and now I don't have them up anymore since I re did my room) and my other idea was a ddr pad but that crashed when I figured out that I need a somthing more like an Arduino Leaonardo since I wanted to hook it up to my pc. </p>

<p> So you are probably wondering why I even told you that and it was just FILLER!! but yea I had an arduino that I wanted to use. I went to the halloween maker expo 2017 because I saw one of my favorite youtubers was going to be there (the hacks smith) but I also saw that a diy pinball people where going to be there so I checked them out even tho I didn't really learn anything from them It did expired me to build my own pinball machine. And yes I did saw James but I didn't talk to him :3 I didn't know what to say so I just looked at the gadgets in PERSON! and moved on (it wasn't even busy yet so I could of talked to him). </p>


<p>So yea I feel like it is about time for me to start talking about what I have for the Pinball machine and honestly not much. I'm
just doing research on it and I have a good idea what I gotta do for the flippers and the pop bumpers.I'm going to use 12v door actuator mainly it seems like it would good and also cheaper! </p>

<h2>The 3D Printer.</h2>

<p>Honestly this is rather straight forward I want a 3D printer pre built or DIY.</p>

<p>The 3D printer would allow me to expand on what kind of projects I can do like cosplay, Robotics, toys, and just simple prints to make things more efficient. Something I want to try is making a EDF powered rc car kinda like Ivan Miranda did. </p>

<h2>Cosplaying the Fallout series.</h2>

<p>This is somthing I wanted to do for awhile. I either want to make the NCR vet. ranger from New Vegas or the t 45 power armour (atleast the helmets). Really the only thing that is stopping me is just spending the money to start making it. It was also because I wasn't sure where to get grey Eva foam however, A person at work who does cosplay pointed out that I am going to paint i anyways. So it doesn't matter what colour it is, I'm not sure why I thought that I need to use grey so all I need is the eva foam wich I am going to cheat and ask for it for christmas 2017 :3 </p>

<p>here are some pictures of the ranger and the power armour.If for some reason you don't play fallout</p>

<p>for the base for the ranger helment would be a fake Army M1 Helmet. It seems like it would be a good base I would also probably have a working light and fan for the helment.For the power armour helmet I'll probaly steal some ideas from Gustav Ljungdahl like using a bucket and a hard hat for the helmet. However, I do want to make the lights working too</p>

<h2>Development to my game Idea.</h2>

<p> Not much to read for this its top secert right now since I don't want the idea  to be stolen because I bet someone else has thought of that idea too. So I won't talk about this in tell I start making it. I have this here just so you know that its somthing I want to do</p>

<hr>

<h2>Improve my site!</h2>

<p> I just feel like I can make this site even better then it is right now maybe better organization IDK we shall see. </p>
