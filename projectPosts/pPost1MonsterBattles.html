<p>Monster Battles, this a old project back when I was in grade 10 S1 it was the only big project we had and we could could what we wanted. I looked at the list of ideas my teacher gave us. The idea that attracted me was an adventure game and being me I wanted to over achive on it. So I came up with this idea make a adventure game but put a more in depth battle. However, I started to run out of time to make it so I cutted it short to get it in on time.</p>
