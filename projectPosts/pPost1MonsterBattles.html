<p>Monster Battles, this a old project back when I was in grade 10 S1 it was the only big project we had and we could could what we wanted. I looked at the list of ideas my teacher gave us. The idea that attracted me was an adventure game and being me I wanted to over achive on it. So I came up with this idea make a adventure game but put a more in depth battle. However, I started to run out of time to make it so I cutted it short to get it in on time.</p>

<p>I tried to also make the computers kinda smart by making it so before it attacks it will look at how much helf it has and based on that it will decide if it should heal block or attack I also threw in a random number too so it would heal every time its below 10. I also added two cheat codes one the first one is if you go into the attack screen and do 1337 and enter. It will do a super power attack that kills in one hit. However I think there is a bug in it since it feels like it misses alot more then a usal attack. The other cheat code is up up down down left right left right (with the arrow keys) B A some where on the shop menu (can't remeber where) you will get alot of YEN. </p>
