	<p>This was a school project in my computers class 2016-17. This was the last big project that was done in java before
	we moved on to very basic html ,css and javascript. It was very simple in nature, I finished what was asked pretty quick but I
    was inspired to take further but more about that in the post!</p>

I have to say this was a realy fun one I did but It might of been because of it was my idea to do it but more about that in the post! </p>
