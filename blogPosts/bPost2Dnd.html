<p>Back in september my friends and I wanted to start up a dnd campaign. Well don't ask me how but I got appointed as DM! Now you may be thinking yea so why does this matter. Well here's why this matters I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO PLAY DND! I told them this also I warned them that I am a very slow reader. So dispite three out of the 7 people who knows how to DM they chose me to be DM.</p>

<p> So in the two mounths of reading the players handbook I was pestered CONSTANLY about if I finished the the books yet (player handbook, Dungeon master handbook, and monsters guide). I just said screw it and finished the player's handbook by skimming it. I'm also not going to read the other two books. I really wanted to be the best DM I could be but I really dont wanna hear them pester me anymore so if I don't get the rules right IDC! </p>

<p> So I spent this week drawing out the map of Kani (crab in Japanese) I called it this because it kinda looks like a crab to me. Before I show the map keep in my this is my first completed map (I was working on a different map but I stopped working on it because it wasn't turing out). Well here is the map. I also went half assed doing the path just because I wanted to get it done </p>

<p> Yup this is why I haven't had a chance to do the things I want. It is because I've been building a campaign for my friends to play. Hopfully I'll be done soon so I can work on my blender.</p>
