	<h2>Why</h2>
<p>Why am I learning Blender? Well like I said So I can make a video game,cosplay, and own a 3D printer. It is quite obvious why I want to learn it for video games and for a 3D printer but what about cosplay? It looks like there is two ways of doing cosplay. One way is just doing it put the foam up to the body, cut and mold it ,and look at referance photos. The other way is to make a 3d model of what you want , then export it to pepakura to print it out, and use the templates too help cut and mold the foam to make the costume. This is the way I want to do since it will give me practice in 3D modeling that I need to know in those other cases.   </p>
